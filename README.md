# My First Project with Java 🛒

This project introduced me to Hyperskill projects, allowing me to practice Java coding by building a program to automate basic account management tasks. I created a tool to calculate net income, which can be used for small business accounting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Imagine you're the owner of a small corner shop. You're doing well and want to determine how much you earned in your first month. This project allowed me to build a simple tool that calculates net income by accounting for total earnings and subtracting expenses like staff, electricity, and security.  


## 🎯 What I Learned  

- Printing item names and prices using Java methods.
- Introduction to Java fundamentals.
- Basic literals: numbers, strings, and characters.
- Writing and executing my first Java program.
- Printing data to the console.
- Performing arithmetic operations to calculate net income.

## 🔧 Features  

✅ Printed the names of items and their prices using custom methods.  
✅ Calculated the total earnings by summing up item sales.  
✅ Subtracted expenses (staff, electricity, and security) to determine net income.  
✅ Provided a reusable tool for small business accounting.

## 📂 Project Structure  

The project was implemented in stages:

1. **Printing Items and Prices**:  
   - Used Java methods to print item names and their respective prices.  

2. **Total Earnings Calculation**:  
   - Summed up the earnings from all sold items.  

3. **Net Income Calculation**:  
   - Subtracted staff, electricity, and security expenses from the total earnings to measure net income.  

## 🤔 How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trayanaboykova/My-First-Project-With-Java.git
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Interact with the program via the console to calculate net income!

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I:

- Practiced writing and executing my first Java program.
- Learned to use Java methods to organize code and print data.
- Strengthened my understanding of literals, arithmetic operations, and user-defined methods.
- Gained confidence in building simple tools for real-world applications.
